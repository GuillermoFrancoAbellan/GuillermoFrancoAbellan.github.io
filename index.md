<p style="line-height:28px;margin-right: -10px; margin-top: 20px;">
I'm Guillermo, and I work as a theoretical physicist specialized in cosmology. I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://www.grappa.amsterdam"> GRAPPA Institute</a>, in the University of Amsterdam. Before this, I completed my PhD in Physics at the LUPM in the University of Montpellier, France, under the supervision of Dr. Vivian Poulin and Dr. Julien Lavalle. Prior to that, I did my undergraduate in Physics at the University of Murcia, Spain.

As a researcher, I work on bridging the gap between theory and observations, with special interest in the phenomenology of beyond-ΛCDM models in cosmological observables. Specifically, I have spent a large part of my time thinking about cosmic tensions and their implications for new physics.
More recently, I've also become interested in the use of machine learning techniques to optimize statistical inference in cosmology. In particular, I'm focusing on novel approaches in simulation-based inference that are significantly faster than traditional methods, and which will allow us to extract the maximum possible information about the universe from future galaxy surveys.
